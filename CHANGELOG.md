## 1.0.0

**Initial stable release ðŸŽ‰**

Changes since RC:  

**Inbox**

* Removed `isDeleted` on `BatchInboxNotificationContent` as it doesn't work like it does on the native SDK due to plugin limitations.

## 1.0.0-rc.2

**Inbox**

* Fix `limit` and `maxPageSize` staying at their default values.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 / 0.1.0

_First Release Candidate_

**Messaging**

* Added Do Not Disturb support.

**Inbox**

* Calling `dispose()` on a disposed fetcher doesn't throw anymore.

* Added `limit` and `maxPageSize` to `getFetcherForInstallation()` and `getFetcherForUser()`.

## 0.0.3

**Inbox**

* Added Batch Inbox support:  
  - Fetchers can be instanciated for both Installation and User modes.
  - `fetchNewNotifications()`, `fetchNextPage()`, `get allNotifications` and `dispose()` have been implemented.
  - `markAsRead()`, `markAsDeleted()` and pagination configuration will come in a later beta.

  Note: This requires `BatchUNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` to be set as your `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` in the native integration.

**User**
